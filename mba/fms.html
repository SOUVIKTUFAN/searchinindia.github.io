	<p><font color="wheat">Faculty of Management Studies (also known as FMS Delhi and The Red Building of Dreams)<br>
	is a business school located in New Delhi, India.<br>
	It was established in 1954 under the aegis of the University of Delhi and is often cited as the best business school<br>
	in India owing to its great ROI and very high placement statistics.<br>
	The institute was started at the Delhi School of Economics premises under the then Dean, A. Das Gupta, of the Delhi College of Engineering (DCE).<br>
	The department of commerce of the Delhi College of Engineering (DCE) now the Delhi Technological University (DTU) was abolished and<br>
	the Faculty of Management Studies was established. The first set of professors were trained at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.<br>
	The institute has since then expanded on the number of management courses available.
