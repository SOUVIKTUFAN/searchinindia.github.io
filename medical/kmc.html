	<p><font color="wheat">Kasturba Medical College, Manipal (KMC) is a medical college based in Manipal, Karnataka, India. Established by T.M.A. Pai on 30 June 1953, KMC was the first self-financing medical college in India. Today, students from 44 countries have graduated from KMC, and the medical degree (MBBS) is recognized worldwide, including by the General Medical Council, ECFMG, Australian Medical Council and Malaysian Medical Council among several others. KMC was under the purview of the Mangalore University. In 1993, the government of India granted Deemed University status to Manipal University (formerly known as MAHE) which saw KMC coming under its wing. KMC has exchange programs with Loma Linda University, United States, Operation Eyesight Universal, Canada, Dundee University, Dundee, Scotland, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, United States and Maastricht University, Netherlands.	<br><br>
